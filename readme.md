# JS-test

Ok so to run the proyect it is required to have the test database [datachement/database](https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db)

## Run backend project

Use the environment example to create you'r own with the credentials of your database
after this simply run the next commands

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Run frontend project

Here the development environmnet will be in use so is not required to add anything

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Disclaimer

I did not add a specific solution for a production build because I don't know what
type of server I'm going to run the apps on, it could use Nginx, apache, docker containers,
so I decided to go with a KISS approach but because the instructions talk about puting,
the code the most production ready as possible thats why I explain my desition
